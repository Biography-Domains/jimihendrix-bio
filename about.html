            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 border-l-4 border-purple-500 pl-4">Early Life (1942-1961)</h2>

            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                James Marshall Hendrix was born on November 27, 1942, in Seattle, Washington, to Al Hendrix and Lucille Jeter. His early life was marked by poverty and family instability. His parents' relationship was turbulent, and they divorced when he was nine years old. His mother passed away when he was just 15, an event that deeply affected him and would later inspire songs like "Angel."
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                Growing up in Seattle's Central District, young Jimmy (as he was then known) showed an early fascination with music. He would strum a broom pretending it was a guitar, and his father Al eventually bought him his first acoustic guitar for $5 when he was 15. He taught himself to play by listening to blues records, particularly those of Muddy Waters, B.B. King, and Robert Johnson.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                Being left-handed in a right-handed world, Hendrix learned to play a right-handed guitar flipped upside down, which would contribute to his unique sound and playing style. He quickly became proficient, joining his first band, The Velvetones, in 1958, and later The Rocking Kings.
            </p>

            <div class="bg-gray-800 rounded-xl p-6 my-8">
                <p class="text-xl italic text-gray-300">"The first guitarist I was aware of was Muddy Waters. I heard one of his old records when I was a little boy and it scared me to death."</p>

        <!-- Army Years -->
        <section class="mb-12">
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 border-l-4 border-orange-500 pl-4">Army & The Chitlin' Circuit (1961-1966)</h2>

            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                In 1961, Hendrix enlisted in the United States Army, joining the 101st Airborne Division as a paratrooper. His military career was brief; he was discharged in 1962 after injuring his ankle during a parachute jump. During his time in the Army, he formed a band called the King Kasuals with bassist Billy Cox, beginning a friendship and musical partnership that would last until Hendrix's death.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                After his discharge, Hendrix moved to Clarksville, Tennessee, then to Nashville, where he began working as a session guitarist and touring musician on the "Chitlin' Circuit" - the network of venues safe for African American performers during the era of racial segregation. He played backup for artists including Little Richard, the Isley Brothers, King Curtis, Ike & Tina Turner, and Sam Cooke.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                These years of sideman work were grueling but educational. Hendrix honed his stagecraft watching showmen like Little Richard and developed his technical skills through constant performing. However, his flamboyant style often clashed with bandleaders who wanted their sidemen to stay in the background. Little Richard famously fired him multiple times for upstaging him on stage.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                In 1965, Hendrix moved to New York City, forming his own band, Jimmy James and the Blue Flames, and playing Greenwich Village clubs like Cafe Wha?. It was here that Animals bassist Chas Chandler discovered him and convinced him to move to London, where his career would truly begin.

        <!-- The Experience -->
        <section class="mb-12">
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 border-l-4 border-pink-500 pl-4">The Jimi Hendrix Experience (1966-1969)</h2>

            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                In September 1966, Hendrix arrived in London under Chas Chandler's management. Chandler helped form The Jimi Hendrix Experience with English musicians Noel Redding on bass and Mitch Mitchell on drums. The trio's chemistry was immediate and explosive.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                London's rock aristocracy took immediate notice. Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and Pete Townshend were all in the audience at early shows, stunned by Hendrix's virtuosity. Within months, the Experience had released three hit singles in the UK: "Hey Joe," "Purple Haze," and "The Wind Cries Mary."
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                The band's debut album, <strong>Are You Experienced</strong> (May 1967), was a landmark in rock music. Hendrix's innovative use of feedback, distortion, and studio effects pushed the boundaries of what the electric guitar could do. The album spent 33 weeks on the UK charts and, after its US release, peaked at #5 on the Billboard 200.
            </p>

            <div class="bg-gray-800 rounded-xl p-6 my-8">
                <h3 class="font-bold text-purple-400 mb-4">The Monterey Pop Festival (June 18, 1967)</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-300">
                    Hendrix's American introduction came at the Monterey Pop Festival, where Paul McCartney had recommended him. His set was explosive - literally. After a blistering performance that included "Wild Thing," Hendrix knelt before his guitar, doused it with lighter fluid, and set it ablaze. The image became iconic, and Hendrix became an instant American star.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                The band quickly followed up with <strong>Axis: Bold as Love</strong> (December 1967), showcasing Hendrix's growing sophistication as a songwriter with tracks like "Little Wing" and "Castles Made of Sand." The album's experimental production techniques, including the accidental discovery of phasing on the title track, influenced recording practices for decades.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                <strong>Electric Ladyland</strong> (October 1968), the only album Hendrix produced himself, was his masterpiece. The sprawling double album featured "Voodoo Child (Slight Return)" and his definitive cover of <a href="https://bobdylan.bio" class="bio-link" target="_blank">Bob Dylan</a>'s "All Along the Watchtower." Dylan was so impressed he adopted Hendrix's arrangement for his own live performances. The album reached #1 in the US - Hendrix's only chart-topping album during his lifetime.

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 border-l-4 border-red-500 pl-4">Woodstock & Final Years (1969-1970)</h2>

            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                By 1969, the original Experience lineup had dissolved due to tensions within the group and Hendrix's desire to explore new musical directions. He assembled a new group, Gypsy Sun and Rainbows, for his appearance at the Woodstock festival in August 1969.
            </p>

            <div class="bg-gray-800 rounded-xl p-6 my-8">
                <h3 class="font-bold text-purple-400 mb-4">The Star-Spangled Banner</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-300">
                    Hendrix closed Woodstock on Monday morning, August 18, with a performance that would define both the festival and his legacy. His solo rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner" used feedback and distortion to evoke the sounds of rockets, bombs, and chaos - a powerful statement on the Vietnam War without speaking a single word. The performance was later added to the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                On New Year's Eve 1969, Hendrix debuted the Band of Gypsys at the Fillmore East with Billy Cox on bass and Buddy Miles on drums. The all-black power trio represented Hendrix's move toward a funkier, more aggressive sound. Their live album, recorded that night, featured the 12-minute anti-war epic "Machine Gun" - considered one of the greatest guitar performances ever recorded.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                In 1970, Hendrix focused on completing Electric Lady Studios in New York City, his dream recording facility. He was also working on a new double album, ultimately released posthumously as "First Rays of the New Rising Sun." He continued to tour extensively, with his final performance at the Isle of Wight Festival on August 30, 1970.

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 border-l-4 border-gray-500 pl-4">Death & Legacy</h2>

            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                On September 18, 1970, Jimi Hendrix was found unresponsive in a London apartment. He had asphyxiated on his own vomit after taking sleeping pills. He was 27 years old, joining the tragic "27 Club" of musicians who died at that age.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                In just four years of mainstream success, Hendrix had revolutionized rock music. His innovative techniques - feedback manipulation, wah-wah effects, the "Hendrix chord" (E7#9), playing with his teeth and behind his head - expanded the vocabulary of the electric guitar. His influence spans every genre that uses the instrument.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                Hendrix has been posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1992), received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award (1992), and was named the greatest guitarist of all time by Rolling Stone magazine. Electric Lady Studios continues to operate as a premier recording facility in New York City.
