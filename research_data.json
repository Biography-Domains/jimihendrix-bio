        "thesis": "Jimi Hendrix appears to be a highly influential rock guitarist and musician whose reputation centers on redefining electric-guitar sound, technique, and stage performance in the late 1960s, leading to enduring critical acclaim (e.g., being framed as a 'guitar god' and ranked extremely highly by major music media). This phase-1 view is based mainly on secondary discussion sources and fan/community materials rather than primary documents or scholarly biographies.",
